Set of problems to assess candidates as part of EX Squared India coding interviews.

## Prerequisites

### Remote Assessement
In case you are taking this coding test remotely, please make sure that your screen is shared with the interviewer. We usually use Slack, Google Meet. You would be told before the interview that what software we would want to use for Screen Sharing. 

### Editor

Candidates can choose any editor for development. Some of our favorites are VS Code, XCode (Swift). Please have the editor already installed on your machine before the test.

### Knowledge of GIT
It is our assumption that you have a basic knowledge of GIT. In case you do not, please let the interviewer know in the begining.

## Branch and Commits

Before starting development please create a new branch from develop branch. Name the branch using following convention

[Current Year]/[First Letter of FirstName][LastName].

### Example
Branch Name for Candidate "Apple Seed" and current year 2020 will be

```
  2020/aseed
``` 

## Tips
* Use consistent coding standards.
* Code should be self explanatory.
* Always ask questions before writing code. Lot of times problem statements are ambigious.
* It is more important how you solve the problem, as compared to reaching to a solution by hit and trial.
